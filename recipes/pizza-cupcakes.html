  <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>They're portable, sort of like a mini pizza, except shaped like a cupcake. They're a great savory snack and a great addition to a game day buffet. Feel free to customize to your family's tastes with additions like ham, sausage, bell peppers, salami, mushrooms, olives, jalapenos, etc. I recommend not omitting the tomato, that really adds something special.</p>

      <li>Cooking Spray</li>
      <li>8 medium cherry tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (11 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust</li>

      <li>Garlic salt to taste</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Step 1
          <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 8 cups of a muffin tin with cooking spray.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
          <p>Finely chop cherry tomatoes and drain any liquid. Set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
          <p>Unroll pizza crust on a floured work surface and roll out thinly into a large rectangle. Using a 4-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut 8 circles in the dough. Place dough circles in the prepared muffin cups, pressing dough into the bottom and up the sides of each cup.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
          <p>Drop 1 teaspoon mozzarella into each cup. Top with 1 tablespoon of pizza sauce. Add chopped tomatoes and red onions. Add 1 tablespoon of mozzarella to each cup, and top with pepperoni. Sprinkle each cup with Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and garlic salt to taste.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 5
          <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and melted, 14 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in the tin for about 5 minutes. Remove from the tin and serve hot.</p>
